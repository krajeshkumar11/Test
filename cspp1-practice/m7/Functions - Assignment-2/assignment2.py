# Assignment-2 - Paying Debt off in a Year

# Now write a program that calculates the minimum fixed monthly payment needed in order pay off a credit card balance within 12 months.
# By a fixed monthly payment, we mean a single number which does not change each month, but instead is a constant amount that will be
# paid each month.

# In this problem, we will not be dealing with a minimum monthly payment rate.

# The following variables contain values as described below:
# balance - the outstanding balance on the credit card
# annualInterestRate - annual interest rate as a decimal

# The program should print out one line: the lowest monthly payment that will pay off all debt in under 1 year, for example:
# Lowest Payment: 180

# Assume that the interest is compounded monthly according to the balance at the end of the month (after the payment for that month is
# made).
# The monthly payment must be a multiple of $10 and is the same for all months. Notice that it is possible for the balance to become
# negative using this payment scheme, which is okay. A summary of the required math is found below:
# Monthly interest rate = (Annual interest rate) / 12.0
# Monthly unpaid balance = (Previous balance) - (Minimum fixed monthly payment)
# Updated balance each month = (Monthly unpaid balance) + (Monthly interest rate x Monthly unpaid balance)
